# IMDB Sentiment Classification 🎬

## 📖 Overview
- This project demonstrates a machine learning pipeline for sentiment classification on IMDB movie reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. 
- The model predicts whether a given movie review has a **positive** or **negative** sentiment Using SVM Machine Learning Algorithm.
- The project is wrapped in an interactive web app built with **Streamlit**, where users can input movie reviews and get real-time sentiment predictions.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Sentiment analysis is the process of determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative, or neutral. For this project, we classify **IMDB movie reviews** into **positive** or **negative** categories.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**: Programming language.
- **Streamlit**: For building the interactive web app.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for training the classification model.
- **NLTK / SpaCy**: For text preprocessing and NLP tasks.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For visualizations.

## 🧠 Model Pipeline
**The model is built using Scikit-learn and includes the following steps:**
- Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, removing stop words, and converting text to lowercase.
- TF-IDF Vectorization: Converts the text data into numerical features.
- Classification: Uses a logistic regression classifier to predict the sentiment (positive/negative).
